        <title>What Led Us to Switch to eXp Realty?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p0uXS0I8SA8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve made the switch to eXp Realty&lt;/strong&gt;, but what about it drew us in? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cloud-based, agent-owned brokerage, eXp utilizes leading-edge technology that facilitates our ability to provide the best service possible to our clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One reason for our switch is their second-to-none training.&lt;/strong&gt; Through the cloud-based system, we have 24 to 30 hours’ worth of live training for our agents each week, and it’s provided by some of the top agents in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=With eXp, we’ll be able to utilize leading-edge technology to provide the best service possible to our clients.%20http://localhost:4000/what-led-us-to-switch-to-exp-realty.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“With eXp, we’ll be able to utilize leading-edge technology to provide the best service possible to our clients.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The collaborative nature to eXp’s approach is another reason for our switch.&lt;/strong&gt; The agents are all aligned and working in concert to achieve goals. If we want to learn how we can set a new mark for home sales in a given year, it’s not coming from the local manager or the brokers. Instead, we’re learning from agents that have hit that mark before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about our switch or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to working with you at eXp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don’t Let Asbestos Go Unabated in Your Home</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQXLgWhOb4w?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m joined once again by home inspector Chris Burrows, and this time we’re talking about where you can find asbestos in your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main areas where asbestos is commonly found: &lt;strong&gt;in floor tiles or around old basement boilers with insulated pipes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latter case, these types of pipes are usually wrapped in friable material, which can become airborne quickly and can contain up to 60% asbestos. At the 0:33 mark in the video above, I’ve included a picture of what this looks like. It’s pretty easy to identify, especially if you live in an older home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Asbestos that’s intact (i.e., not coming apart) is less of a concern unless it’s friable material, which can break apart.%20http://localhost:4000/dont-let-asbestos-go-unabated-in-your-home.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Asbestos that’s intact (i.e., not coming apart) is less of a concern unless it’s friable material, which can break apart.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fiber count of asbestos found in floor tiles is usually 2% to 10% lower than found in wrapped pipes. Asbestos that’s intact (i.e., not coming apart) is less of a concern unless it’s friable material, which can break apart. In either case, &lt;strong&gt;it’s important that you test these areas to see if you need to perform an asbestos abatement.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more asbestos questions for Chris, you can call his office at (201) 840-6126 or visit his website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmburrowsinc.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.cmburrowsinc.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, if you have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Step-by-Step Explanation of the Mold Inspection Process</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/KZoS6qZggAU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris says when he first receives a call, the symptoms are often described as a musty smell or a leak from the roof or roof deck. &lt;strong&gt;The first test he’ll conduct is what’s called the “air cassette test.”&lt;/strong&gt; This test will draw in samples of the air to test its quality for any form of mold that can be a health hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The litmus test that Chris uses to determine whether or not there are dangerous levels of mold within the home is measuring the inside air against the air outdoors.&lt;/strong&gt; Outside air will always contain mold, and should, therefore, be at higher levels than what’s inside the home. That will signal to Chris just how safe or poor the air quality is in the home—especially in the bedrooms and living space.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Outside air will always contain mold, and should, therefore, be at higher levels than what’s inside the home.%20http://localhost:4000/a-step-by-step-explanation-of-the-mold-inspection-process.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Outside air will always contain mold, and should, therefore, be at higher levels than what’s inside the home.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that’s done, Chris will extract and inspect a physical sample from Sheetrock in the home. He swabs the Sheetrock to determine the type of mold and its effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He’ll then use a strip of tape, for what is called a “tape lift,” to seal the mold down onto the Sheetrock, and it’ll be sent off to the lab for further analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, Chris will conduct a visual assessment of the property as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice a musty smell or you’ve experienced water damage in your home, Chris is a great source to call upon to protect against the toxic effects of mold. Reach out and get in touch with him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any other real estate-related questions or concerns, be sure to get in touch with me as well. I’d be happy to assist you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>An Example of a Tool We Use to Serve Your Real Estate Needs</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tw0U3m8Pmk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a behind-the-scenes soldier that does a lot of work for us here at the Sikora Group that I’d like to highlight today: &lt;strong&gt;our all-in-one letter folder, envelope stuffer, and envelope sealer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine allows us to produce up to 1,300 envelopes in an hour. If a buyer wants a property in a specific neighborhood and wants us to map out that whole area, we &lt;strong&gt;can then go into the tax records, pull out everyone’s address, upload them into our machine, and then print all their names on the envelopes and folders.&lt;/strong&gt; After that, we tuck our mailers in one of the machine’s slots, and the machine stuffs and seals the envelopes. All we then have to do is stamp and send  them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=This machine allows us to produce up to 1,300 envelopes in an hour.%20http://localhost:4000/an-example-of-a-tool-we-use-to-serve-your-real-estate-needs.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“This machine allows us to produce up to 1,300 envelopes in an hour.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tool is just another part of our arsenal to make sure that we help our buyers and sellers from every angle; with it, we can reach people when doing so by phone isn’t an option, and it’s also useful for blanket mailings. &lt;strong&gt;It benefits both buyers looking for off-market properties and also our sellers looking to announce open houses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the ways that we help our buyers and sellers or about real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Does the Mold Removal Process Look Like?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TobnNEcosBw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mold is never a welcome sight for homeowners, but fortunately, taking care of this problem before it becomes a bigger problem isn’t difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show you what the mold removal process entails, I’ve brought in Justin Guyre of Renew Restoration, and I’m using the house my wife and I are currently building as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently had a water leak between the second and third floors of the unit, and we called Justin and his team to test for mold. Once the results came back positive, they got started on the remediation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you find mold in your home, the first thing you should do is identify the source of it,&lt;/strong&gt; whether it’s from relative humidity or direct water contact. Mold can’t grow without water, so once the source is identified, you can get to work on removing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Removal experts like Justin rely heavily on the data they find when performing their tests because there are many different species of mold and not all of them are harmful. The species that grow on building materials and are water damage indicators, however, must be removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Mold can’t grow without water, so once the source is identified, you can get to work on removing it.%20http://localhost:4000/what-does-the-mold-removal-process-look-like.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Mold can’t grow without water, so once the source is identified, you can get to work on removing it.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, they identified the species of mold that was present, where the water leak was coming from and proceeded to remove as much of the affected material as they could that wasn’t structural. After that, they disinfected the parts of the structure that were impacted and set up proper air scrubbing so they could clean the air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, they post-tested the environment to check that the area was back to a “Condition 1” state. After we close the walls and finish the home, we’ll test the air one more time before we move in to ensure everything is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you understand what’s causing mold in your home, there are many cost-effective things you can do yourself to fix it and prevent it from happening again. &lt;strong&gt;Proper dehumidification is very important in areas like your basement, so keep your humidity levels below 65% all year long.&lt;/strong&gt; If you let it rise above 65% for an extended period of time, don’t be surprised to open up a closet door one day and find mold growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a situation like that, where there’s no direct water contact, you might not need a total mold removal—you might just need to remove the spores. In other situations, such as when mold grows on your home’s sheetrock from direct water contact, you’ll have to remove the sheetrock entirely instead of just cleaning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? According to Justin, the molds that grow this way typically have hyphae, or the root system of their vegetative growth. You have to remove the sheetrock entirely to make sure that you can kill that root system and clean any mold that’s spread to the structure of the house, itself. &lt;strong&gt;By HEPA vacuuming and air scrubbing, this issue can be fixed without doing a tremendous amount of extra work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any more questions about mold removal, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Difference Between a Short Sale and a Foreclosure</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwiDzeOerjM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get questions about what short sales and foreclosures are, as well as which one is best for buyers. Today we’ll be going over what the key differences between them are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate a short sale, let’s say a seller owes $500,000 on their property’s mortgage but wants to sell it for $400,000. The bank will take a hit of $100,000 if they agree to do so. The problem is that short sale properties can take a long time (six to 12 months) to sell. If it’s taking too long, the bank could change their mind and request more from the seller. It could turn out to be a waste of your time if the bank ultimately decides to sell to a new lender and they then foreclose the home. &lt;strong&gt;If you get involved in a short sale, make sure it’s good and that you’re able to wait awhile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Between a foreclosure and a short sale, we’ve found you’ll often get a better price on foreclosures.%20http://localhost:4000/the-difference-between-a-short-sale-and-a-foreclosure.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Between a foreclosure and a short sale, we’ve found you’ll often get a better price on foreclosures.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, foreclosures are already owned and have regular transaction times. You could close in 15 to 30 days, get a mortgage, and treat the process as you would when buying a regular home. Most foreclosures are sold as-is, so you won’t find sellers willing to make many repairs. Between a foreclosure and a short sale, we’ve found you’ll often get a better price on foreclosures. &lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately, we don’t see many foreclosures come on the market,&lt;/strong&gt; and the ones that do are often purchased quickly by investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we prefer the pursuit of foreclosures, we can still help you with any short sales you may be interested in. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions or need more information. We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Market Shift Is Here and Your Equity Could Be at Risk</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/HWHV2-OTl-s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s been happening with our Jersey City/Hoboken area market so far in 2018? How should sellers feel about our fall market moving forward? Let’s look at the latest year-to-date statistics and how they compare to the same numbers from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of new listings in Jersey City increased 35% from 798 to 1,216 homes on the market. There are more homes for buyers to choose from, and this increase has created a healthier market in downtown Jersey City. The number of sales, meanwhile, decreased from 477 to 402. That’s not a huge change, but keep in mind that we have a lot of new construction inventory that’s not showing up on the MLS. &lt;strong&gt;Sales are still out there and buyers are still buying—you just need to give them a reason to buy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=Sales are still out there, and buyers are still buying—you just need to give them a reason to buy.%20http://localhost:4000/the-market-shift-is-here-and-your-equity-could-be-at-risk.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“Sales are still out there, and buyers are still buying—you just need to give them a reason to buy.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Hoboken, the number of new listings increased 22% from 1,139 to 1,460 homes on the market. Unlike Jersey City, though, the number of sales in this area increased slightly from 688 to 705.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data tells us that a shift is happening in our market, but I don’t think home values are going to dip because the banking industry is still very strong. &lt;strong&gt;If you’ve been on the fence about selling, I recommend that you do it now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that note, we’re confident that our marketing strategies can help you get your home sold for top dollar, so if you would like to get started now, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any further questions about our fall market, feel free to give us a call or send us an email as well. We’d love to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Should You Ask an Agent Before You Hire Them?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/LFeP7e8V15s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking to hire an agent to help you purchase a new home, ask these three questions to ensure they’re the right pick for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;post-cta&quot;&gt;
Want to sell your home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://brett.sellwithsikora.com/home-valuation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Get a FREE home value report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy a home? &lt;a href=&quot;http://brett.sellwithsikora.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Search all homes for sale.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three things that you should ask a potential buyer’s agent before you decide to work with them. This is especially true since we’ve reached the hot, competitive spring market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. “How many homes did you sell in the last 12 months?”&lt;/strong&gt; The national average, according to the National Association of Realtors, is four or five homes in 12 months. We’re seeing agents out there that are doing 100 or more transactions, but even if the agent is doing 24 or 25, it’s a healthy balance that indicates they know what they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=An agent’s last three clients can let you know how their processes went and whether or not they had a good experience.%20http://localhost:4000/what-should-you-ask-agent-before-you.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“An agent’s last three clients can let you know how their processes went and whether or not they had a good experience.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. “Can I reach out to your last three clients?”&lt;/strong&gt; Ask if you can reach out to the last three buyers they helped purchase a home. Those people can let you know how their processes went and whether or not they had a good experience. Did they trust the agent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. “What strategy will you use to get me into the home?”&lt;/strong&gt; What are they doing to inform you about the market? In areas like Hoboken, Jersey City, Chatham, and Summit, we’re seeing a lot of bidding wars. They’re not as common as they were in the past, but you definitely want to make sure that your agent is going to put their best foot forward in order to ensure that you get the property you desire for the price you want and in the time frame you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions for me about buying a home or hiring an agent, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>4 Different Loan Products for Homebuyers</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SD6IzmkZ98Y?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a homebuyer, you should know what your options are when it comes to financing your purchase. I’ll go over four different types of loans for you today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of different loan products that you can use to purchase your home. I’ll go over four of them today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most popular loan is conventional financing backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. This loan requires 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% down, and you can use this option on a condo or single-family home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is FHA financing. An FHA loan lets you move into a home with as little as 3.5% down. The private mortgage insurance rate does end up being a bit higher, but the FHA loan also works well with a lower credit score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=An FHA loan lets you move into a home with as little as 3.5% down.%20http://localhost:4000/4-different-loan-products-for-homebuyers.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“An FHA loan lets you move into a home with as little as 3.5% down.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 203k loan is similar to the FHA loan but it allows you to rehab the property. The 203k program gives you money to make upgrades and renovate the home. Of course, they are going to come in and monitor the work to make sure that it’s done by a qualified contractor. Still, that’s a great product if you want to renovate a bank-owned or short sale property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final product is the homestyle loan. This is similar to the 203k loan but you do have to put a bit more money down than you would for an FHA. You can’t use the FHA or 203k on a condo, but you can use a homestyle loan. The homestyle loan will also finance construction costs. Again, they will monitor your process to make sure you are working with a qualified contractor. This is a great product to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any other questions about buying a home, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Whats Happening So Far in the Spring Real Estate Market?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZdrUJAzLzQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should you expect from the 2018 spring real estate market? I have some good tips on what to keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report.&lt;br /&gt;
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s going on in the spring market of 2018?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that I’ve been seeing quite a bit lately is that for multi-family owners, the numbers have changed significantly since last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that if you’re looking to purchase a home and you need to sell your current home first in order to do so, keep in mind that &lt;strong&gt;it’s still a seller’s market,&lt;/strong&gt; so you should be able to find a buyer easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the buyer’s side of things, you’ll definitely need to be as aggressive as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; You’ll probably need to have your current home under contract before you buy a new one. Fortunately, since it’s a seller’s market, you can dictate exactly what’s going on in that transaction. A lot of times, the buyers that are purchasing the homes you’re selling don’t need to be in there at a certain time; they’re usually month-to-month rentals, they might have a lease ending, or they’re staying at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/home/?status=When it comes to putting offers on properties, I always say to come in strong.%20http://localhost:4000/whats-happening-so-far-in-spring-real.html%20via%40&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;pullquote&quot;&gt;“When it comes to putting offers on properties, I always say to come in strong.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can start with a contract and include a clause that says the purchase of the home is contingent on your finding your home in a certain period of time. You can also get a leaseback contingency, where you have 60 days to occupy the home post-closing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to putting offers on properties, I always say to come in strong. If there are multiple offers on the home, &lt;strong&gt;you’ll need a strong number to be accepted by the seller.&lt;/strong&gt; We hate to see a tough negotiation in which the price is driven down quite a bit, but then a second offer comes in and starts to look much better to the seller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about the spring market or buying and selling a home, please feel free to reach out to me. I’d be glad to help.&lt;/p&gt;
