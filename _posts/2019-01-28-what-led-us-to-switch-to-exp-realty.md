**We’ve made the switch to eXp Realty**, but what about it drew us in? 

As a cloud-based, agent-owned brokerage, eXp utilizes leading-edge technology that facilitates our ability to provide the best service possible to our clients. 

**One reason for our switch is their second-to-none training.** Through the cloud-based system, we have 24 to 30 hours’ worth of live training for our agents each week, and it’s provided by some of the top agents in the world.

**The collaborative nature to eXp’s approach is another reason for our switch.** The agents are all aligned and working in concert to achieve goals. If we want to learn how we can set a new mark for home sales in a given year, it’s not coming from the local manager or the brokers. Instead, we’re learning from agents that have hit that mark before.

If you have any questions about our switch or anything else related to real estate, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to working with you at eXp!<br>
