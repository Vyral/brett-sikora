The first step in buying a home isn’t looking online for properties. It’s answering these five questions about your financial situation.

If you’re thinking about buying a home, here are five questions that you should ask yourself before you even start the first step of the process:

**1. Do you have a steady source of income?** If you’ve been employed on a regular basis with a steady level of income, that’s a good start.

**2. Do you have a good record of paying bills?** This will affect your credit and will also tell a lender whether you’re responsible enough to handle a mortgage payment.

**3. Do you have enough money for a down payment?** You only need 3.5% with an FHA loan, but a majority of people put down 20% to avoid paying private mortgage insurance.

**4. Do you have any outstanding debts?** Any kind of monthly payment you have could affect your debt-to-income ratio.

**5. Can you pay the mortgage each month with additional costs?** When you pay rent, that’s typically all the money you have to worry about (save utilities and cable). When you own a home, there are a lot of extra costs that come up. Whether you have to replace an appliance or fix a hole in the wall, you’ll need to have enough money to do that.

If you can answer yes to all of these questions, it might be time to give us a call and get a buyer consultation set up. Then we can get you pre-approved with our preferred lender and begin your search.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
