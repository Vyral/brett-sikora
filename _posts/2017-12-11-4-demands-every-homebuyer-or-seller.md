There are a few things you need to ensure that your agent does for you. Here are four of the most important.

Want to sell your home? Get a FREE home value report.  
Want to buy a home? Search all homes for sale.

When you are buying a home, there are four things you should absolutely demand of your agent:

**1. Tell the truth about pricing.** Many agents will tell you that it’s fine to lowball a seller, but most times it ends up with you either paying more for the property or losing it altogether. They should understand the market and know what a strong offer looks like and be confident enough to convey the importance of making one.

**2. Understand the timetable your family is dealing with.** If you need to close quickly, your agent needs to understand that. A good agent should be able to adapt to your timeline, rather than the other way around.

**3. Remove as many of the challenges as possible.** Appraisal and home inspection issues aren’t uncommon, so knowing how to negotiate those things and get to the closing table is huge.

**4. Find the right house.** Don’t rush it. I see clients all the time feeling like they need to buy or need to get into a home. Your agent should not be pushing you to make a purchase if you aren’t ready. It’s best to take your time because this is a huge decision.

If you have any questions about why these demands are important or want to know how we help our buyers in the home search process, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
