  Today I’m joined by Chris Burrows, a home inspector who has long-served our
  area, to discuss mold in the home and how he tests for its presence.

  Outside air will always contain mold, and should, therefore, be at higher
  levels than what’s inside the home.

Chris says when he first receives a call, the symptoms are often described as a musty smell or a leak from the roof or roof deck. **The first test he’ll conduct is what’s called the “air cassette test.”** This test will draw in samples of the air to test its quality for any form of mold that can be a health hazard.

**The litmus test that Chris uses to determine whether or not there are dangerous levels of mold within the home is measuring the inside air against the air outdoors.** Outside air will always contain mold, and should, therefore, be at higher levels than what’s inside the home. That will signal to Chris just how safe or poor the air quality is in the home—especially in the bedrooms and living space. &nbsp;

Once that’s done, Chris will extract and inspect a physical sample from Sheetrock in the home. He swabs the Sheetrock to determine the type of mold and its effects.

He’ll then use a strip of tape, for what is called a “tape lift”, to seal the mold down onto the Sheetrock, and it’ll be sent off to the lab for further analysis.

Beyond that, Chris will conduct a visual assessment of the property as well.

If you notice a musty smell or you’ve experienced water damage in your home, Chris is a great source to call upon to protect against the toxic effects of mold. Reach out and get in touch with him.
