If you’re looking to hire an agent to help you purchase a new home, ask these three questions to ensure they’re the right pick for you.

There are three things that you should ask a potential buyer's agent before you decide to work with them. This is especially true since we’ve reached the hot, competitive spring market.  

**1. “How many homes did you sell in the last 12 months?”** The national average, according to the National Association of Realtors, is four or five homes in 12 months. We’re seeing agents out there that are doing 100 or more transactions, but even if the agent is doing 24 or 25, it’s a healthy balance that indicates they know what they’re doing.

**2. “Can I reach out to your last three clients?”** Ask if you can reach out to the last three buyers they helped purchase a home. Those people can let you know how their processes went and whether or not they had a good experience. Did they trust the agent?

**3. “What strategy will you use to get me into the home?”** What are they doing to inform you about the market? In areas like Hoboken, Jersey City, Chatham, and Summit, we’re seeing a lot of bidding wars. They’re not as common as they were in the past, but you definitely want to make sure that your agent is going to put their best foot forward in order to ensure that you get the property you desire for the price you want and in the time frame you want it.

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or hiring an agent, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you.
