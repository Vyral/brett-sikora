I often get questions about what short sales and foreclosures are, as well as which one is best for buyers. Today we’ll be going over what the key differences between them are.

To illustrate a short sale, let’s say a seller owes $500,000 on their property’s mortgage but wants to sell it for $400,000. The bank will take a hit of $100,000 if they agree to do so. The problem is that short sale properties can take a long time (six to 12 months) to sell. If it’s taking too long, the bank could change their mind and request more from the seller. It could turn out to be a waste of your time if the bank ultimately decides to sell to a new lender and they then foreclose the home. **If you get involved in a short sale, make sure it’s good and that you’re able to wait awhile.**

On the other hand, foreclosures are already owned and have regular transaction times. You could close in 15 to 30 days, get a mortgage, and treat the process as you would when buying a regular home. Most foreclosures are sold as-is, so you won’t find sellers willing to make many repairs. Between a foreclosure and a short sale, we’ve found you’ll often get a better price on foreclosures. **Unfortunately, we don’t see many foreclosures come on the market,** and the ones that do are often purchased quickly by investors.
