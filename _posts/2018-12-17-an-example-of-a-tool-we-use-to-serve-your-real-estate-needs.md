There is a behind-the-scenes soldier that does a lot of work for us here at the Sikora Group that I’d like to highlight today: **our all-in-one letter folder, envelope sealer, and envelope stuffer.**

This machine allows us to produce up to 1,300 envelopes in an hour. If a buyer wants a property in a specific neighborhood and wants us to map out that whole area, we **can then go into the tax records, pull out everyone’s address, upload them into our machine, and then print all their names on the envelopes and folders.** After that, we tuck our mailers in one of the machine’s slots, and the machine stuffs and seals the envelopes. All we then have to do is stamp and send&nbsp; them out.

This tool is just another part of our arsenal to make sure that we help our buyers and sellers from every angle; with it, we can reach people when doing so by phone isn’t an option, and it’s also useful for blanket mailings. **It benefits both buyers looking for off-market properties and also our sellers looking to announce open houses.**

If you have any questions about the ways that we help our buyers and sellers or about real estate in general, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d be glad to hear from you.
