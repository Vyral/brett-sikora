Mold is never a welcome sight for homeowners, but fortunately, taking care of this problem before it becomes a bigger problem isn’t difficult.

To show you what the mold removal process entails, I’ve brought in Justin Guyre of Renew Restoration, and I’m using the house my wife and I are currently building as an example.

We recently had a water leak between the second and third floors of the unit, and we called Justin and his team to test for mold. Once the results came back positive, they got started on the remediation process.

**If you find mold in your home, the first thing you should do is identify the source of it,** whether it’s from relative humidity or direct water contact. Mold can’t grow without water, so once the source is identified, you can get to work on removing it.

Removal experts like Justin rely heavily on the data they find when performing their tests because there are many different species of mold and not all of them are harmful. The species that grow on building materials and are water damage indicators, however, must be removed.

In our case, they identified the species of mold that was present, where the water leak was coming from, and proceeded to remove as much of the affected material as they could that wasn’t structural. After that, they disinfected the parts of the structure that were impacted and set up proper air scrubbing so they could clean the air.

Once that was done, they post-tested the environment to check that the area was back to a “Condition 1” state. After we close the walls and finish the home, we’ll test the air one more time before we move in to ensure everything is safe.

If you understand what’s causing mold in your home, there are many cost-effective things you can do yourself to fix it and prevent it from happening again. **Proper dehumidification is very important in areas like your basement, so keep your humidity levels below 65% all year long.** If you let it rise above 65% for an extended period of time, don’t be surprised to open up a closet door one day and find mold growing.

In a situation like that, where there’s no direct water contact, you might not need a total mold removal—you might just need to remove the spores. In other situations, such as when mold grows on your home’s sheetrock from direct water contact, you’ll have to remove the sheetrock entirely instead of just cleaning it.

Why? According to Justin, the molds that grow this way typically have hyphae, or the root system of their vegetative growth. You have to remove the sheetrock entirely to make sure that you can kill that root system and clean any mold that’s spread to the structure of the house, itself. **By HEPA vacuuming and air scrubbing, this issue can be fixed without doing a tremendous amount of extra work.**

If you have any more questions about mold removal, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
