Today I’m joined once again by home inspector Chris Burrows, and this time we’re talking about where you can find asbestos in your home.

There are two main areas where asbestos is commonly found: **in floor tiles or around old basement boilers with insulated pipes.**

In the latter case, these types of pipes are usually wrapped in friable material, which can become airborne quickly and can contain up to 60% asbestos. At the 0:33 mark in the video above, I’ve included a picture of what this looks like. It’s pretty easy to identify, especially if you live in an older home.

The fiber count of asbestos found in floor tiles is usually 2% to 10% lower than found in wrapped pipes. Asbestos that’s intact (i.e., not coming apart) is less of a concern unless it’s friable material, which can break apart. In either case, **it’s important that you test these areas to see if you need to perform an asbestos abatement.**

If you have any more asbestos questions for Chris, you can call his office at (201) 840-6126 or visit his website [www.cmburrowsinc.com](http://www.cmburrowsinc.com){: target="_blank"}.

As always, if you have any real estate questions, feel free to call or email me. I’d be happy to help you.
